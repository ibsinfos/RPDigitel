                    <p class="ans">A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode consisting of a black and white pixel pattern which allows to
                    encode up to a few hundred characters. Today's smartphones and tablets are able to recognize and decode
                    them exceptionally fast - it's not surprising that QR stands for Quick Response.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="col-sm-6">
                    <h4 class="ques">How are QR codes used?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">Due to the widespread use of smartphones, QR Codes are mosly used for mobile marketing purposes these
                    days. Marketers benefit from QR Codes by being able to add digital content like websites, videos, PDFs,
                    image galleries or contact details to printed media such as flyers, posters, catalogues and business
                    cards.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">How can I create a QR code?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">With a QR Code Generator a QR Code can be created within seconds and in three simple steps. At first,
                    choose the function for your Code. Secondly, enter the content that you want to provide your customers
                    and optionally give it a unique look by adjusting the colors and uploading a logo into it. Finished with
                    that, Then your Code is ready for downloading and printing.</p>

                <li class="col-sm-6">
                    <h4 class="ques">Is it possible to customize QR Codes?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">Yes. Thanks to a high error tolerance level, it is possible to modify QR Codes to a certain degree
                    without influencing its legibility at all. For example, you can choose new fore- and background colours,
                    place your company logo right in the middle of the Code and change the design of the three distinctive
                    corner points. Remember to rnake sure that your Code actually works by testing it practically with
                    several smartphones and QR Code readers.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">What are static and dynamic QR codes?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">With dynamic QR Codes it is possible to edit their functions and target addresses - even when they have
                    already been printed. They also allow the collection of statistics conceming scan numbers and locations,
                    as well as the exact date and time of accesses. Dynamic Codes use a so-called short URL which forwards
                    users to your target address. Static Codes do not provide these features but link directly to your
                    content without any short URL.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">How can I measure the number of scans of QR codes?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">The measurement or 'tracking'. of scans is possible with dynamic QR codes. A forwarding URL which is
                    connected to the respective providers' server collects the relevant data. All this real time information
                    is then available for you directly in the account.</p>

                    <p class="ans"> We recommend to use high resolution file formats for printing. Besides JPG and PNG files, vector formats
                    such as EPS and SVG are also suitable. The latter two are especially useful for bigger print sizes as
                    they can be enlarged without any quality losses. To be on the safe side always do a practical test
                    before publishing.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">What other aspects are important in connection with printing QR Codes?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">Apart from the relevant file format, further aspects need to be considered. In general, the print size
                    should be determined in relation to the number of characters encoded. If rather much content is encoded,
                    accordingly more space is required. A size of approximately 2 x 2 cm should be sufficient in most cases.
                    Better avoid uneven surfaces. Wrinkles on leaflets and flyers might also impact the Codes' legibility in
                    a negative way.</p>

                <li class="col-sm-6 paddingRight">
                    <h4 class="ques">How can QR codes be scanned?</h4>
                    <p class="ans"> Decoding QR Codes needs nothing more than a mobile phone or tablet and a QR Code reader that is
                    installed on that device. These QR Code readers are freely available to download from all App Stores. To
                    scan the Code, simply launch the App and wait until the camera automatically detects it. Within seconds
                    the encoded content is dispalyed on the screen. As a benchmark for the quality of the app, you may refer
                    to the average review rating in the App Stores.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">How can I use QR codes successfully?</h4>
                    <p class="ans">Put yourself in the shoes of your target audience and ask yourself whether you would scan the Code you're
                    looking at. Are you excited about what the Code might reveal, Do you expect value or helpful information
                    from it, Users put effort into interacting with your advertisement and expect something in return for
                    that. Ideally present your content using a mobile website that is adapt. to the respective display size
                    and makes it more comfortable for users to navigate through it. Provide value added content and make
                    your Code attract people by making use of the various customization options. A simple call to action
                    like 'Scan this Code to find out more" has also proven successful and will surely encourage more people
                    to see what's behind the Code.</p>

                    <h4 class="ques">History of QR Codes</h4>
                    <p class="ans">As early as 1994 people took advantage of the QR Code's practical features: Denso Wave, a Japanese
                    subsidary of the Toyota supplier Denso, developed them for marking components in order to accellerate
                    logistic processes for their automobile production. In their country of origin the use of QR Codes is so
                    well established that even the Japanese Immigration Office put them on their residence permits. In the
                    meantime, QR Codes found their way to Europe over the past couple of years and are intemationally
                    standardized now. What makes QR Codes particularly advantageous is that up to 30 percent of their
                    surface may be damaged, dirty or altered in other ways without effecting their legibility and
                    functionality at all.</p>

                    <h4>Application possibilities of QR Codes</h4>
                    <p class="ans">The conceivable applications are almost infinite. Especially when encoding URI, many different contents
                    are possible. These include homepages, product sites, videos, picture galleries, coupon codes,
                    competitions, contact forms or any other types of online forms, social media sites and so on. Many other
                    contents do not even require an active internet connection of the used phone. Those are e.g. calendar
                    events, WiFi connections or vCards that contain personal contact information which then can easily be
                    added to the address book. QR Codes may be placed on web pages, print ads, products or any other flat
                    surfaces.</p>
